# Google Cloud Architect Notes

This repository contains study notes from grantcarthew (https://github.com/grantcarthew/notes-google-cloud-architect). I added my notes for studying the Google Cloud Platform to sit the Cloud Architect exam.

I passed the exam and am leaving this repository here for anyone else to use.

__These notes have not been proof read or polished in any way. They are accurate as of June 2019.__

## Build PDF

These notes can be built into PDF (or any format for that matter) to make it easier to read and review.

There is a pre-built set of PDF documents in the [pdf](/pdf) directory.

### How to build on Windows

If you wish to build the documents yourself there is a PowerShell script in the root of the repository called [ConvertTo-PDF](/ConvertTo-PDF.ps1).

1. Install [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) if it is not already installed.
1. Install [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) if it is not already installed.
1. Clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/).
1. Open a PowerShell console.
1. Change directory to the root of the repository.
1. Run the PowerShell script by typing `.\ConvertTo-PDF.ps1`.

The script will delete the current `pdf` directory and then recreate it by building the documents from the markdown files.
