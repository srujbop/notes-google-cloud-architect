## Concepts

* Topics
* Messages - payload is always base-64-encoded, atttributes are not
* Subscription - referred as __queues__ in other messaging systems
* Acknowledge deadline

* Producer --> Tpoic --> Subscription --> Consumer
* Pull subscription vs Push subscription (call back handler)
* Fan-out broadcast messaging vs Work-queue messaging (distributing work)
