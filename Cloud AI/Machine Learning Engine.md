# Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine

[Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data, of any size. A hosted service for machine learning that can provide infrastructure to handle __storage__, __training__, and __prediction__.

Train the model --> Predict based model

Training machine-learning models is very computationally intensive. Retraining needs spikes of demand for resources. --> Great fit for the cloud model.
